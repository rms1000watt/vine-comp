# Vine Compilation Bot
This is a script written in Python (2.7) for scraping [Vine][1] data from the official [Vine API][2].  This project is comprised of two main scripts, the scraper and the renderer.  This currently does not work with Python 3.

The scraper uses [Pandas][3] (my favorite data analysis library) to process and sort the Vine response data, which also depends on [Numpy][6] to function.  Other dependencies are [requests][4] and [lxml][5] for scraping popular tags from the vine homepage.

The renderer employs [moviepy][7] to first composite each individual vine video with its title, user, rank, and optional channel/user image.  The video and audio streams of each rendered vine is then losslessly concatenated into a final render.  The vines are not rendered all at once to keep memory requirements down, as having all the vine filesMoviepy uses ffmpeg to create the videos, which should be installed automatically now that moviepy uses [image.io][8] to handle that dependency.

## Scraping Abilities
The main scraping options are official Vine channels (comedy, animals, urban, fashion, food etc.), user timelines, and tags.  

Playlists can be added using a combined source of tags and or users. For example, one could create a worldstarhiphop comp using the tags (wshh, wshhv, worldstar, worldstarhiphop, vinefights, fighting, knockedout, knockout, twerk, twerkteam, twerking).

The playlist file located in meta/playlists.csv contains three columns: name, tags, and users. Name specifies the playlist name, which will also be used as the filename for the playlist metadata. Tags are a space separated list of tags without the hash.  Users is a space separated list of userId numbers, not the username.

## Installation

OS X 

``` 
brew install opencv
brew install imagemagick
brew install ffmpeg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Scraper
Update all channels and playlists, retrieve all pages
> python scraper.py -u

Update all channels and playlists, retrieve <= n pages
> python scraper.py --update=15

Download vine video files for the top (90) vines in the specified vine  metadata file. Files are located in meta/ and are csv formatted.  The files are either for a channel, user, or playlist name.
> python scraper.py --download=comedy

Delete all temporary files, including metadata files. meta/playlists.csv is spared from this operation because it is not a temporary file.
> python scraper.py --flush

Delete just the rendered vines in render/
> python scraper.py --flush=render

### Renderer
Render top n vines of the specified channel/playlist
> python render.py --name=comedy --limit=90

Individual vine renders can be found in render/ and final renders can be found in render/finals/ with the filename as the channel or playlist name

### To-Do
* Add rolling date check to only retain vines posted within the specified amount of time
* Finish implementing the trending tags scraping
* Allow for tag/user cadence within playlist videos, such that the playback of vines follow a certain order. e.g. (twerk, twerk, wshh, vinefight, twerk, 934940633704047000)
* Archive metadata after rendering finishes
